To connect to a server, run:
$ ssh -p port user@server-address


SSH can be configured to deny remote logins with the root user by editing

/etc/ssh/sshd_config.

Simply change #PermitRootLogin yes to no and uncomment the line:

/etc/ssh/sshd_config

PermitRootLogin no

...
Next, restart the SSH daemon:

# systemctl restart sshd

You will now be unable to log in through SSH under root,
but will still be able to log in with your normal user and use su or sudo to do system administration.
