Text not showing because of fonts not found on the system.
For some reason, Dota has it's own font configuration folder that overrides
the system defaults located at

~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/dota 2 beta/game/core/panorama/fonts/conf.d

A workaround if you don't want to install Microsoft Fonts.

Red Hats Liberation fonts, the ttf-liberation font package includes a
configuration file that aliases Arial to Liberation located at

/etc/fonts/conf.avail/30-ttf-liberation-sans.conf

sudo pacman -S ttf-liberation

Arial is the font that Dota can't find and messes up your UI.

So, the workaround is to copy that file to the Dota font directory
or create it if you don't have it.

Here's a copy of the file if you need it:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM "../fonts.dtd">
<fontconfig>
         <!-- Microsoft -->
        <alias binding="same">
          <family>Arial</family>
            <accept>
              <family>Liberation Sans</family>
            </accept>
        </alias>
        <alias binding="same">
          <family>Liberation Sans</family>
            <default>
              <family>Arial</family>
            </default>
        </alias>
</fontconfig>

You can just copy-paste that and save it as

~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/dota 2 beta/game/core/panorama/fonts/conf.d/30-ttf-liberation-sans.conf

If you don't have Liberation installed, change the two instances to DejaVu Sans, Droid Sans,
or whatever you happen to have installed on your system.
