I found a workaround to this if you don't want to install Microsoft Fonts.
For some reason, Dota has it's own font configuration folder that overrides
the system defaults located at

steamapps/common/dota 2 beta/game/core/panorama/fonts/conf.d.

Sounds pretty silly to me but I guess Valve has their reasons.

Anyway, on Arch at least, the ttf-liberation font package includes a
configuration file that aliases Arial to Liberation
(located at /etc/fonts/conf.avail/30-ttf-liberation-sans.conf.)
Arial is the font that Dota can't find and messes up your UI.

So, the workaround is to copy that file to the Dota font directory
or create it if you don't have it. Here's a copy of my file if you need it:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM "../fonts.dtd">
<fontconfig>
         <!-- Microsoft -->
        <alias binding="same">
          <family>Arial</family>
            <accept>
              <family>Liberation Sans</family>
            </accept>
        </alias>
        <alias binding="same">
          <family>Liberation Sans</family>
            <default>
              <family>Arial</family>
            </default>
        </alias>
</fontconfig>

You can just copy-paste that and save it as

steamapps/common/dota 2 beta/game/core/panorama/fonts/conf.d/30-ttf-liberation-sans.conf.

If you don't have Liberation installed, change the two instances to DejaVu Sans, Droid Sans,
or whatever you happen to have installed on your system.
