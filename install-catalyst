Before attempting to install the AMD Catalyst™ Linux Graphics Driver
the following software must be installed:

Xorg/Xserver 7.4 and above (up to 1.16)
Linux kernel 2.6 or above (up to 3.17)
glibc version 2.2 or 2.3
POSIX Shared Memory (/dev/shm) support is required for 3D applications

The legacy Catalyst driver does not support Xorg Server 1.17.

To get X Org servers version from command line, do: 

Xorg -version

Should you want to use this driver, instructions on how to roll back to Xorg Server 1.16:

Unofficial user repositories (use the same PGP key as for the catalyst repository).
Remember to add the chosen repository above all other repositories in pacman.conf,
even above your catalyst repository, should you use one.

In order to use these repositories, you will have to add them to /etc/pacman.conf,
as explained in pacman#Repositories.
If a repository is signed, you will have to obtain and locally sign the associated key,
as explained in Pacman-key#Adding unofficial keys.

Catalyst does not support xorg-server 1.17

[xorg116]
Server = http://catalyst.wirephire.com/repo/xorg116/$arch
## Mirrors, if the primary server does not work or is too slow:
#Server = http://mirror.rts-informatique.fr/archlinux-catalyst/repo/xorg116/$arch
#Server = http://mirror.hactar.bz/Vi0L0/xorg116/$arch

[catalyst]
Server = http://catalyst.wirephire.com/repo/catalyst/$arch
## Mirrors, if the primary server does not work or is too slow:

#Server = http://mirror.rts-informatique.fr/archlinux-catalyst/repo/catalyst/$arch

put [xorg116] repo first, then [catalyst] repo

pacman -Syuu catalyst catalyst-utils

pacman -S catalyst-hook catalyst-utils catalyst-libgl opencl-catalyst

pacman -S lib32-catalyst-utils lib32-catalyst-libgl lib32-opencl-catalyst


### ########################################
### Adding unofficial keys
### #########################################

Key-ID: 653C3094

You can use this method, for example, to add your own key to the pacman keyring,
or when enabling a signed unofficial repository.

Note: You may first need to run dirmngr as root

First get the key ID (keyid) from the owner of the key.

Then you need to add the key to the keyring:

If the key is found on a keyserver, import it with:
# pacman-key -r keyid

If otherwise a link to a keyfile is provided, download it and then run:
# pacman-key --add /path/to/downloaded/keyfile

Always be sure to verify the fingerprint, as you would with a master key, or any other key which you are going to sign.
$ pacman-key -f keyid

Finally, you need to locally sign the imported key:
# pacman-key --lsign-key keyid
You now trust this key to sign packages.


### #########################################
### Configuring the driver
### #########################################
After you have installed the driver via your chosen method,
you will have to:

1. Configure X to work with Catalyst.
2. make sure the module gets loaded at boot.
3. Also, one should disable kernel mode setting.


### ##########################################
### Configuring X
### ##########################################

To configure X, you will have to create an xorg.conf file.

Catalyst provides its own aticonfig tool to create and/or modify this file.
It also can configure virtually every aspect of the card for it also accesses the
/etc/ati/amdpcsdb file.

For a complete list of aticonfig options, run:

# aticonfig --help | less

## Warning ##
Use the --output option before committing to /etc/X11/ as an xorg.conf
file will override anything in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/

Now, to configure Catalyst.

If you have only one monitor, run this:

# aticonfig --initial

### #############################################
### Loading the module at boot
### #############################################

We have to blacklist the radeon module to prevent it from auto-loading.
Add the line:

blacklist radeon

in

/etc/modprobe.d/modprobe.conf

Also make sure that it is not loaded by any file under /etc/modules-load.d/.
For more information, see kernel modules#Blacklisting.

Then we will have to make sure that the fglrx module gets auto-loaded.
Either add fglrx on a new line of an existing module file located under /etc/modules-load.d/,
or create a new file and add fglrx.

/etc/modules-load.d/catalyst.conf


grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg


### ################################################
### Disabling modesetting
### ################################################

Disable KMS for various reasons, such as getting a blank screen or a "no signal" error from the display,
when using the Catalyst driver, etc.

To disable KMS add nomodeset as a kernel parameter.

There are three ways to pass options to the kernel and thus control its behaviour:
When building the kernel. See Kernel Compilation for details.
When starting the kernel (usually, when invoked from a boot loader).
At runtime (through the files in /proc and /sys). See sysctl for details.

### GRUB2

manually edit /boot/grub/grub.cfg

add at the end of the string:

linux /boot/vmlinuz-linux root=/dev/sda3 initrd=/boot/initramfs-linux.img quiet splash
