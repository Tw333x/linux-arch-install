# Install network manager and the GNOME applet

$ pacman -S networkmanager network-manager-applet

NetworkManager is controlled via NetworkManager.service.

Once the NetworkManager daemon is started,
it will automatically connect to any available "system connections" that have already been configured.

Any "user connections" or unconfigured connections will need nmcli or an applet to configure and connect.

$ systemctl enable NetworkManager.service
$ systemctl start NetworkManager.service
